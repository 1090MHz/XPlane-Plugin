![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Overview

This repository contains an example X-Plane plugin demonstrating the implementation of essential callbacks required for initialization, resource management, and event handling. The plugin showcases how to interact with the X-Plane SDK to integrate custom functionality into the simulator environment.

## Features

- **XPluginStart**: Initializes the plugin and registers necessary callbacks.
- **XPluginEnable**: Optional callback for enabling plugin-specific resources.
- **XPluginDisable**: Optional callback for disabling plugin-specific resources.
- **XPluginStop**: Cleans up resources and unregisters callbacks before plugin unload.
- **XPluginReceiveMessage**: Handles incoming messages from X-Plane or other plugins.
